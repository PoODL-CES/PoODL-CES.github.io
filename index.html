  <h1>Population and Organism Diversity Laboratory</h1>
<p>
  In the Population and Organism Diversity Lab at the Centre for Ecological Sciences (CES), Indian Institute of Science, we study diversity of populations of the speceis around us. We are especially interested in understanding how small populations survive or go extinct.
